Password Strength Checker
This project is a Python-based password validation and generation tool that ensures users create strong and secure passwords. It verifies passwords based on the following criteria:

âœ… Minimum 8 characters
âœ… At least one uppercase letter
âœ… At least one lowercase letter
âœ… At least one digit
âœ… At least one special character

If a password does not meet these requirements, the program provides helpful feedback and offers a randomly generated strong password. Users are given up to two attempts before the program exits.

ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used: Python, Regular Expressions (re), Random Module
ðŸ”¹ Use Case: Secure authentication systems, password strength enforcement
